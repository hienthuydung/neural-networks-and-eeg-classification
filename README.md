This rep contains the data and codes used in the bachelor's thesis "EEG-Klassifikation mittels maschinellem Lernen: Wie neuronale Netzwerke epileptische Anfälle erkennen können" by Thuy Nguyen.

The data consists of the original 24h EEG-Signal segmented into 5 parts (EDF files) as well as the labeled and segmented 4s inputs (CSV files).

The codes contained are the implemented neural networks (fully-conected feed forward networks, convolutional networks, recurrent network) by Thuy Nguyen as well as the scripts for reading in and segment the EDF file by Valentin Neubert and Diyuan Lu.
