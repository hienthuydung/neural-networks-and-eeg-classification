This rep contains the data and codes used in the bachelor's thesis "EEG-Klassifikation mittels maschinellem Lernen: Wie neuronale Netzwerke epileptische Anfälle erkennen können" by Thuy Nguyen.

The data consists of the original 24h EEG-Signal segmented into 5 parts (EDF files) as well as the labeled and segmented 4s inputs (zipped CSV files).

The codes contained are the implemented neural networks by Thuy Nguyen as well as the script for reading in and segmenting the EDF file (FIN_read_segment) by Valentin Neubert and Diyuan Lu. For the fully-conected feed forward networks go to "FIN_FFN_1-5_layers", for the convolutional networks got to "FIN_CNN_1-5_layers", for the recurrent network go to "FIN_RNN".
